          Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is a 2024 Australian post-apocalyptic action
          film directed and produced by George Miller, who wrote the screenplay
          with Nico Lathouris. It is the fifth installment in Miller's Mad Max
          franchise, and the first not focused on series protagonist Max
          Rockatansky, instead acting as both a spinoff prequel to Mad Max: Fury
          Road (2015) and an origin story for the Fury Road character Furiosa,
          portrayed by Anya Taylor-Joy and Alyla Browne in the prequel. Set 15
          to 20 years before the events of Fury Road, the film follows the title
          character's life for over a decade, from her kidnapping by the forces
          of warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth) to her ascension to the rank of
          Imperator. Tom Burke also stars as Praetorian Jack, a military
          commander who befriends Furiosa. Several Fury Road cast members return
          in supporting roles, including John Howard, Nathan Jones, and Angus
          Sampson reprising their characters.

          Wingard. Produced by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner
          Bros. Pictures, it is a sequel to Kong: Skull Island (2017) and
          Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019), and is the fourth film in the
          Monsterverse. It is also the 36th film in the Godzilla franchise, the
          12th film in the King Kong franchise, and the fourth Godzilla film to
          be completely produced by an American film studio.[b] The film stars

          Henry, Shun Oguri, Eiza González, Julian Dennison, Lance Reddick, Kyle

          Earth, homeworld of the monsters known as "Titans", to retrieve a
          power source for a secret weapon intended to stop Godzilla's
          mysterious attacks.
